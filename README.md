# Seattle Parks Complete

I had a goal of visiting every park in Seattle but I had no good way of
tracking them and the official [city
site](http://www.seattle.gov/parks/listall.asp) was not very
user-friendly. I created this site and to minimize the overhead I just
use localStorage to keep track of pakrs visited. This could easily be
transformed into other location based checklists such as libraries,
baseball stadiums, etc.
