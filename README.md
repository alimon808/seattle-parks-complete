# Seattle Parks Complete

I had a goal of visiting every park in Seattle but I had no good way of
tracking them and the official [city
site](http://www.seattle.gov/parks/listall.asp) was not very
user-friendly which lead me to create this site. I'm just using a leaflet layer and localStorage to keep track of individual parks visited. The basic framework of this site could easily be
transformed into other location based checklists such as libraries,
baseball stadiums, etc.
